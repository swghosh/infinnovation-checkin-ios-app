# Infinnovation E-Check-In iOS App

The participating schools are required to use this app to be able to check into Delhi Public School Newtown's eco-commerce fest, Infinnovation. The check-in procedure involves providing the Unique ID assigned to the respective school and the details of all the participants of the same school. 

Check-in passes generated from the application will be only valid 5th of October 12:00 am and onwards. Participating schools are requested to save a screenshot of the generated check-in pass from the application and produce it at our front desk so as to be given ID cards.

The app is now available for use through the iOS App Store.
